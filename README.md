Elman neural network
=====================

This project is an individual student work on the development of the Elman network for predicting numerical series. 
In the course of the work, the basics of Jordan and Jordan-Elman network development were also studied, but only one network was developed. 
Python was used as the development language. No special libraries were used. 
Calculations are made on the functions written manually.
